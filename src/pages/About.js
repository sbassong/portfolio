            I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a strong background in Microbiology research and STEM education. As a microbiologist, I grew passionate about creating and finding solutions in a collaborative environment. I have been fortunate to find fulfillment in supporting others through accessible and meaningful learning experiences.
            <br className="hidden lg:inline-block" /><br className="hidden lg:inline-block" />
            As a web developer, Iâ€™m having a blast continuously improving my skills and exploring technologies. I am building responsive and features-rich full stack platforms through both solo and collaborative projects. I am seeking more opportunities to grow and leverage my skills and experience to help improve accessibility and promote equity-minded practices.
